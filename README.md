# Flutter Firebase Playground

**Flutter Firebase Playground** is a demo app developed in Flutter that integrates with Firebase to demonstrate best practices in using Firebase services such as Remote Config, Crashlytics, Analytics, and more. The app is structured using **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

## Features

-   **Version Control**: The app checks the current version against Firebase Remote Config and prompts the user to update if they are using an outdated version.
-   **Crash Reporting**: Integration with Firebase Crashlytics for logging both fatal and non-fatal errors.
-   **Analytics**: Custom event logging using Firebase Analytics to track app interactions.
-   **Crypto Data Fetching**: The app fetches cryptocurrency exchange rates from a mock API and displays the data in an intuitive UI.
